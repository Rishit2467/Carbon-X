## � Project Description

Carbon-X is a decentralized smart contract platform built on the Stellar blockchain using the Soroban SDK. It enables the tokenization, verification, and exchange of carbon credits representing measurable CO₂ offsets from certified environmental projects worldwide.

The platform ensures transparency, integrity, and liquidity in the carbon credit market by leveraging blockchain-based immutability and automated smart contract operations. Through Carbon-X, verified carbon credits are tokenized into digital assets that can be securely traded or permanently retired, establishing a trusted and accessible ecosystem for climate action participants, corporations, and individuals.

## 🌐 Project Vision

Our vision is to transform the global carbon offset ecosystem by creating a transparent, decentralized, and liquid marketplace for verified carbon credits. Carbon-X aims to:

**Promote Environmental Accountability**: Enable verifiable, tamper-proof carbon credit transactions recorded on the Stellar blockchain.

**Enhance Market Transparency**: Eliminate information asymmetry through on-chain verification and public registries.

**Empower Sustainability Projects**: Provide project developers with direct access to a global liquidity pool without intermediaries.

**Ensure Trust and Integrity**: Guarantee that all credits listed, traded, or retired are validated by authorized verifiers.

**Foster Inclusive Participation**: Allow organizations and individuals worldwide to offset their carbon footprint through decentralized, accessible tools.

## ⚙️ Key Features

### 1. Carbon Credit Tokenization

- Each carbon credit batch is tokenized as a unique on-chain asset
- Metadata includes: `project_id`, `issuer`, `vintage_year`, `region`, `verified_by`, `quantity`, and `retired` status
- Supports both fungible and non-fungible representations of carbon credits

### 2. Registry & Verification

- Authorized verifiers can register and verify carbon credit batches
- Verification data is stored immutably on-chain for full transparency
- Only whitelisted verifier accounts can perform verification actions

### 3. Marketplace Exchange

- Users can list verified carbon credits for sale in a decentralized marketplace
- Built-in escrow mechanism ensures safe and atomic trade settlement
- Transactions support Stellar Lumens (XLM) and compatible stablecoins

### 4. Retirement System

- Users can retire carbon credits, permanently removing them from circulation
- Retirement actions emit transparent, immutable on-chain events
- Retired credits are viewable via a public retirement ledger for accountability

### 5. Access Control

- Administrative address manages verifier whitelisting and key parameters
- Role-based permissions prevent unauthorized minting or verification
- Ensures governance flexibility for protocol upgrades

### 6. Event Logging & Transparency

- Emits events for all critical actions: verification, minting, listing, sale, and retirement
- Provides an immutable audit trail for regulators, buyers, and verifiers
- Enhances compliance and trust in carbon markets

## 🚀 Future Scope

- **Integration with Freighter Wallet**: Seamless user experience for signing and managing Stellar transactions
- **Carbon Credit NFTs**: Expand to include unique project-based NFT representations
- **Oracle Integration**: Incorporate external carbon verification APIs for automated validation
- **Governance DAO**: Transition toward community-based governance for verifier and protocol decisions
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Enable interoperability with other climate finance ecosystems
